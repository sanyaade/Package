# Spark documentation (v3.0.0)

## Introduction

Because you have downloaded this then I am assuming you know what Spark is, if not here is a quick overview.

    Spark is a great JavaScript library which can animate, perform AJAX calls, parse / stringify JSON and convert colors plus a whole lot more which I simply do not have enough time to go into.

Got it? Good. So in this document, which was lovingly coded by the developer of Spark ([Oliver Caldwell](http://flowdev.co.uk/)), you will find a step by step guide of how to use the library.

In the next section you will also find links to the source files although you probably saw them on your way in. The source files are `spark.js` and `spark.min.js` from this folder.
