This is the download package for the [Spark JavaScript library](http://sparkjs.co.uk/) ([repository](https://github.com/SparkJS/Spark)). It contains the latest stable version in its raw form and a minified version that has been passed through the Google closure complier.

This package also contains the documentation and any useful plugins.

It is advised you open the file `documentation.html` and read through to learn how to use the library.

To build the package you will need [redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet) installed to parse the markdown. If you have it, simply run `make`.

The built package is called `Spark.zip`.
