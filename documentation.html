<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Because you have downloaded this then I am assuming you know what Spark is, if not here is a quick overview.</p>

<pre><code>Spark is a great JavaScript library which can animate, perform AJAX calls, parse / stringify JSON and convert colors plus a whole lot more which I simply do not have enough time to go into.
</code></pre>

<p>Got it? Good. So in this document, which was lovingly coded by the developer of Spark (<a href="http://flowdev.co.uk/">Oliver Caldwell</a>), you will find a step by step guide of how to use the library.</p>

<p>In the next section you will also find links to the source files although you probably saw them on your way in. The source files are <code>spark.js</code> and <code>spark.min.js</code> from this folder.</p>

<h2>Getting the source</h2>

<p>So to grab the source files you are going to want to navigate to the folder this file is located in and copy either <code>spark.js</code> or <code>spark.min.js</code>.</p>

<p>The only difference between them is that one has been minified with the <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google closure compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Or alternatively you can follow these links to either the <a href="spark.js">development</a> or <a href="spark.min.js">minified</a> versions of Spark.</p>

<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>You guessed it, we are kicking off with a hello world just to get you used to the syntax of the API.</p>

<p>I have added a file called <code>template.html</code> into this folder which you can insert your JavaScript right into.</p>

<p>So first off we are going to need to wait until the DOM is ready before we go messing with it. So we always start off <em>every</em> script with the following code.</p>

<pre><code>Spark.ready(function() {
    // Your code will go here
});
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and add that into the script tag in the template that says <code>Your code goes here</code>.</p>

<p>Now we are going to create and insert a paragraph tag into the DOM with this line.</p>

<pre><code>$('body').insertElement('p', 'Hello, World!');
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you refresh your page <strong>boom!</strong>, the world gets greeted by your page. How sweet.</p>
	</body>
